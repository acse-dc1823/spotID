# IRP

This is your IRP repository. You must **submit your deliverables** (project plan, final report, and presentation slides) to this repository before the deadlines specified in the IRP Guidelines. In addition, you are expected to **submit your code** here. If, for instance, you are working on an external project and your code is confidential, or you were asked by your supervisor(s) to work in another repository, your code does not have to be submitted here. In that case, you must discuss and agree with both supervisors as soon as possible on how they can access your code. Finally, please keep the `title.toml` file up to date - whenever the title of your project changes, please ensure that this is reflected in `title.toml`.

- For instructions on submitting your **deliverables**, check [`deliverables/README.md`](deliverables/README.md).
- To learn how to update the `title.toml` file, refer to [`title/README.md`](title/README.md).

We will collect your deliverables and the project title from this repository automatically. Therefore, you must follow the instructions in the README files. To ensure your submissions of deliverables and the modifications to `title.toml` are correct, we defined several workflows in GitHub Actions. You can see their status in the Actions tab of this repository or on the badges in README files. It usually takes some time for the badge status to update, even after refreshing the page. Therefore, to see the real-time status of the workflow, check the `Actions` tab.

After you familiarise yourself with this repository, you can delete the content of this `README.md` and populate it with your project-specific information. :)
